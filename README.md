# Object-Detection
This model is trained on a subset of Caltech-101 dataset and uses a pretrained VGG-16 network for predicting both bounding boxes and class labels.

I came to know the basics from a blog by:
Adrian Rosebrock,Multi-class object detection and bounding box regression with Keras, TensorFlow, and Deep Learning,
